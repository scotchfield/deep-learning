# Chapter 2: Linear Algebra

**Scalar**: A single number. When we introduce them, we specify what kind of number they are.

**Vector**: An array of numbers, arranged in order. We can think of vectors as identifying points in space, with each element giving the coordinate along a different axis.

**Matrix**: A 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identified by two indices instead of just one.

**Tensor**: An array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes.

**Broadcasting**: The addition of a matrix and a vector, yielding another matrix: **C = A + _b_**. In other words, the vector **_b_** is added to each row of the matrix.

**Matrix inverse**: Denoted as **A^-1^** and defined as the matrix such that **A^-1^A = I**~n~.
